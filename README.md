Mettle is a character designer for role-playing games. 

It scratches an itch for me. The itch looks like this;

A lot of games have you build a character by spending points on skills from a big list. [Call of Cthulhu](http://www.chaosium.com/forms/coc_quick_start_color.pdf) is like that; Accounting, Anthropology, Archeology, etc. Some of those skills are clearly related -- a professor of archeology should be pretty good at anthropology, history, and library use. A soldier should be good at handguns, machine guns, and rifles. But these games don't make it easy to build characters with balanced character sheets. For our professor, every point spent on Archeology is a point he can't spend on History. For our soldier, every point spent in rifle means he has fewer points to spend on handguns. Odd, isn't it? Mettle flips that round, and establishes relationships between skills, so that when you spend points in one skill, it calculates an effective score for the related skills. Our professor of archeology is now not quite as ignorant of history as he would have been. 

This system is really easy to use -- just click on some important skills, and the character will start being built, and all the related skills get built automatically. This means you might only need to choose a small number of skills to get a fully-developed character. 

For people running games
==========

If you are running a game, you'll need to design a set of skills and tell us how they relate together. We'll show you how to do that.

You will also find this system really convenient for developing NPCs. It's very easy to build bit-part NPCs using this system. Just choose a couple of key skills, bash in a load of points for that skill, and the character will be built with a sensible cascade of skills. 

For players looking to build characters.
==========

 If you are a player, your GM will point you at a designer for his particular system. Then all you need to do is click on skills, and start using the plus and minus icons to juggle points in the different skills.
